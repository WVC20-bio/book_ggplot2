abstract = {Behaviors are challenging to reconstruct for extinct species, particularly the nature and origins of acoustic communication. Here we unravel the song of Archaboilus musicus Gu, Engel and Ren sp. nov., a 165 million year old stridulating katydid. From the exceptionally preserved morphology of its stridulatory apparatus in the forewings and phylogenetic comparison with extant species, we reveal that A. musicus radiated pure-tone (musical) songs using a resonant mechanism tuned at a frequency of 6.4 kHz. Contrary to previous scenarios, musical songs were an early innovation, preceding the broad-bandwidth songs of extant katydids. Providing an accurate insight into paleoacoustic ecology, the low-frequency musical song of A. musicus was well-adapted to communication in the lightly cluttered environment of the mid-Jurassic forest produced by coniferous trees and giant ferns, suggesting that reptilian, amphibian, and mammalian insectivores could have also heard A. musicus' song.},

abstract = {The rapid increase in volume and complexity of biomedical data requires changes in research, communication, and clinical practices. This includes learning how to effectively integrate automated analysis with high–data density visualizations that clearly express complex phenomena. In this review, we summarize key principles and resources from data visualization research that help address this difficult challenge. We then survey how visualization is being used in a selection of emerging biomedical research areas, including three-dimensional genomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), the protein structure universe, phosphoproteomics, augmented reality–assisted surgery, and metagenomics. While specific research areas need highly tailored visualizations, there are common challenges that can be addressed with general methods and strategies. Also common, however, are poor visualization practices. We outline ongoing initiatives aimed at improving visualization practices in biomedical research via better tools, peer-to-peer learning, and interdisciplinary collaboration with computer scientists, science communicators, and graphic designers. These changes are revolutionizing how we see and think about our data.},

With its low cost and scalability, crowdsourcing presents an attractive option for evaluating the large design space of visualizations; however, it first requires validation. In this paper, we assess the viability of Amazon's Mechanical Turk as a platform for graphical perception experiments. We replicate previous studies of spatial encoding and luminance contrast and compare our results. We also conduct new experiments on rectangular area perception (as in treemaps or cartograms) and on chart size and gridline spacing. Our results demonstrate that crowdsourced perception experiments are viable and contribute new insights for visualization design. Lastly, we report cost and performance data from our experiments and distill recommendations for the design of crowdsourced studies.},

By identifying and synthesizing dispersed data on production, use, and end-of-life management of polymer resins, synthetic fibers, and additives, we present the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever manufactured. We estimate that 8300 million metric tons (Mt) as of virgin plastics have been produced to date. As of 2015, approximately 6300 Mt of plastic waste had been generated, around 9\% of which had been recycled, 12\% was incinerated, and 79\% was accumulated in landfills or the natural environment. If current production and waste management trends continue, roughly 12,000 Mt of plastic waste will be in landfills or in the natural environment by 2050.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate critically Carl Wunderlich's axioms on clinical  thermometry. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of baseline oral temperature data from volunteers participating in Shigella vaccine trials conducted at the University of Maryland Center for Vaccine Development, Baltimore. SETTING: Inpatient clinical research unit. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-eight healthy men and women aged 18 through 40 years. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Oral temperatures were measured one to four times daily for 3 consecutive days using an electronic digital thermometer. RESULTS: Our findings conflicted with Wunderlich's in that 36.8 degrees C (98.2 degrees F) rather than 37.0 degrees C (98.6 degrees F) was the mean oral temperature of our subjects; 37.7 degrees C (99.9 degrees F) rather than 38.0 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) was the upper limit of the normal temperature range; maximum temperatures, like mean temperatures, varied with time of day; and men and women exhibited comparable thermal variability. Our data corroborated Wunderlich's in that mean temperature varied diurnally, with a 6 AM nadir, a 4 to 6 PM zenith, and a mean amplitude of variability of 0.5 degrees C (0.9 degrees F); women had slightly higher normal temperatures than men; and there was a trend toward higher temperatures among black than among white subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-seven degrees centigrade (98.6 degrees F) should be abandoned as a concept relevant to clinical thermometry; 37.2 degrees C (98.9 degrees F) in the early morning and 37.7 degrees C (99.9 degrees F) overall should be regarded as the upper limit of the normal oral temperature range in healthy adults aged 40 years or younger, and several of Wunderlich's other cherished dictums should be revised.},

abstract = {The diversity of life is heterogeneously distributed across the Earth. A primary cause for this pattern is the heterogeneity in the amount of energy, or primary productivity (the rate of carbon fixed through photosynthesis), available to the biota in a given location1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. But the shape of the relationship between productivity and species diversity is highly variable10,11,12,13,14. In many cases, the relationship is ‘hump-shaped', where diversity peaks at intermediate productivity7,9,10,12,15,16,17,18. In other cases, diversity increases linearly with productivity4,5,6,10,11,12. A possible reason for this discrepancy is that data are often collected at different spatial scales10,12,14. If the mechanisms that determine species diversity vary with spatial scale, then so would the shape of the productivity–diversity relationship. Here, we present evidence for scale-dependent productivity–diversity patterns in ponds. When the data were viewed at a local scale (among ponds), the relationship was hump-shaped, whereas when the same data were viewed at a regional scale (among watersheds), the relationship was positively linear. This dependence on scale results because dissimilarity in local species composition within regions increased with productivity.},

abstract = {The Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) members display different host-specificities and virulence phenotypes. Here, we have performed a comprehensive RNAseq and methylome analysis of the main clades of the MTBC and discovered unique transcriptional profiles. The majority of genes differentially expressed between the clades encode proteins involved in host interaction and metabolic functions. A significant fraction of changes in gene expression can be explained by positive selection on single mutations that either create or disrupt transcriptional start sites (TSS). Furthermore, we show that clinical strains have different methyltransferases inactivated and thus different methylation patterns. Under the tested conditions, differential methylation has a minor direct role on transcriptomic differences between strains. However, disruption of a methyltransferase in one clinical strain revealed important expression differences suggesting indirect mechanisms of expression regulation. Our study demonstrates that variation in transcriptional profiles are mainly due to TSS mutations and have likely evolved due to differences in host characteristics.},

In severe but not mild COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2-specific T.cells displayed low functional avidity and clonality, despite increased frequencies.

In this way two common summary visualizations of prediction potential in datasets are formed—correlation matrices and correlation heatmaps. Both of these visualizations are focused on the presentation of correlation between pair of attributes but not much more regarding the context of correlations in the dataset. The main objective of this article is the design and implementation of graphical models usable in a visual representation of data prediction potential—correlation graphs and correlation chains—which emphasize the pseudo-transitivity of prediction potential in a dataset.},

Elucidating pathomechanisms has been hampered by disease heterogeneity and difficulties accessing motor neurons. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons (iPSMNs) offer a solution; however, studies have typically been limited to underpowered cohorts. Here, we present a comprehensive compendium of 429 iPSMNs from 15 datasets, and 271 post-mortem spinal cord samples. Using reproducible bioinformatic workflows, we identify robust upregulation of p53 signalling in ALS in both iPSMNs and post-mortem spinal cord. p53 activation is greatest with C9orf72 repeat expansions but is weakest with SOD1 and FUS mutations. TDP-43 depletion potentiates p53 activation in both post-mortem neuronal nuclei and cell culture, thereby functionally linking p53 activation with TDP-43 depletion. ALS iPSMNs and post-mortem tissue display enrichment of splicing alterations, somatic mutations, and gene fusions, possibly contributing to the DNA damage response.},

abstract = {The treatment of diarrhea in the postweaning period is a common reason for the use of antimicrobials in pig production, and Escherichia coli is the single most important causative agent for this condition. Colistin has recently been classified as a critically important antimicrobial for human health, as it is a last-resort drug against certain multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, the use of colistin has been significantly reduced in some countries, including Denmark. Despite this, the drug is still commonly used to treat diarrhea in pigs in many countries, and there is a need to understand the risks associated with this practice. We performed a prospective cohort study to investigate the effect of colistin treatment on the changes in the average minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in commensal E. coli in a pig herd where no colistin-resistant bacteria were detectable before treatment. One group of pigs was batch treated with colistin after the clinical observation of diarrhea, one group was batch treated with colistin approximately 10 days before the expected onset of diarrhea, and a control group was not treated with colistin but provided with nonantimicrobial antidiarrheal feed supplement. Treatment with colistin in the dose and time combinations used did not result in a significant increase in the average colistin MIC values in E. coli. Moreover, no E. coli strains showed a MIC above the breakpoint of >2 mg/L against colistin. Co-selection of resistance to other antimicrobials was not observed.},

abstract = {Stacked bar charts are a visualization method for presenting multiple attributes of data, and many visualization tools support these charts. To assess the efficacy of stacked bar charts in supporting attribute-comparison tasks, we conducted a user study to compare three types of stacked bar charts: classical, inverting, and diverging. Each chart type was used to visualize six attributes of data where half of the attributes have the characteristics of ‘lower better' whereas the other half attributes are with ‘higher better.' Thirty participants were asked to perform two types of comparison tasks: single-attribute and overall-attribute comparisons. We measured the completion time, error rate, and perceived difficulty of the comparison tasks. The results of the study suggest that, for overall-attribute comparisons, the inverting stacked bar chart was the most effective with regards to the completion time. The results also show that performing overall-attribute comparisons using the classical and diverging stacked bar charts required more time than performing single-attribute comparisons using these charts. Participants perceived the inverting and diverging stacked bar charts as easier-to-use than the classical stacked bar chart for overall-attribute comparisons. However, for single-attribute comparisons, all chart types delivered similar performance. We discuss how these findings can inform the better design of interactive stacked bar charts and visualization tools.},

abstract = {Lianas (climbing woody vines) are important structural parasites of tropical trees and may be increasing in abundance in response to global-change drivers. We assessed long-term (∼14-year) changes in liana abundance and forest dynamics within 36 1-ha permanent plots spanning ∼600 km2 of undisturbed rainforest in central Amazonia. Within each plot, we counted each liana stem (≥2 cm diameter) and measured its diameter at 1.3 m height, and then used these data to estimate liana aboveground biomass. An initial liana survey was completed in 1997–1999 and then repeated in 2012, using identical methods. Liana abundance in the plots increased by an average of 1.00\% ± 0.88\% per year, leading to a highly significant (t = 6.58, df = 35, P < 0.00001) increase in liana stem numbers. Liana biomass rose more slowly over time (0.32\% ± 1.37\% per year) and the mean difference between the two sampling intervals was nonsignificant (t = 1.46, df = 35, P = 0.15; paired t tests). Liana size distributions shifted significantly ($\chi$2 = 191, df = 8, P < 0.0001; Chi-square test for independence) between censuses, mainly as a result of a nearly 40\% increase in the number of smaller (2–3 cm diameter) lianas, suggesting that lianas recruited rapidly during the study. We used long-term data on rainfall and forest dynamics from our study site to test hypotheses about potential drivers of change in liana communities. Lianas generally increase with rainfall seasonality, but we found no significant trends over time (1997–2012) in five rainfall parameters (total annual rainfall, dry-season rainfall, wet-season rainfall, number of very dry months, CV of monthly rainfall). However, rates of tree mortality and recruitment have increased significantly over time in our plots, and general linear mixed-effect models suggested that lianas were more abundant at sites with higher tree mortality and flatter topography. Rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2, which may stimulate liana growth, might also have promoted liana increases. Our findings clearly support the view that lianas are increasing in abundance in old-growth tropical forests, possibly in response to accelerating forest dynamics and rising CO2 concentrations.

abstract = {Drug combinations can expand options for antibacterial therapies but have not been systematically tested in Gram-positive species. We profiled $\sim$8,000 combinations of 65 antibacterial drugs against the model species Bacillus subtilis and two prominent pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Thereby, we recapitulated previously known drug interactions, but also identified ten times more novel interactions in the pathogen S. aureus, including 150 synergies. We showed that two synergies were equally effective against multidrug-resistant S. aureus clinical isolates in vitro and in vivo. Interactions were largely species-specific and synergies were distinct from those of Gram-negative species, owing to cell surface and drug uptake differences. We also tested 2,728 combinations of 44 commonly prescribed non-antibiotic drugs with 62 drugs with antibacterial activity against S. aureus and identified numerous antagonisms that might compromise the efficacy of antimicrobial therapies. We identified even more synergies and showed that the anti-aggregant ticagrelor synergized with cationic antibiotics by modifying the surface charge of S. aureus. All data can be browsed in an interactive interface (https://apps.embl.de/combact/).},

abstract = {The boxplot is a powerful visualization tool of sampled continuous data sets  because of its rich information delivered, compact size, and effective visual expression. The advantage of boxplots is not widely appreciated. Many top journals suggest that boxplots should be used in place of bar charts, but have been wrongly replaced by bar charts. One technical barrier to the usage of boxplots in reporting quantitative data is that bench scientists are not competent in generating boxplots, and are afraid of R, a programming tool. This tutorial provides an effective training material in that even a novice without prior R experience can become competent, within one day, in generating professional boxplots. The available R scripts for boxplots are very limited in scope and are aimed at specialists, and the bench scientists have difficulty in following these scripts. This tutorial provides extensive step-by-step R scripts and instructions, as well as 29 illustrations for customizing every detail of the boxplot structures. Basic R commands and concepts are introduced for users without prior R experiences, which can be skipped by audiences with R knowledge. Violin plots are the enhanced version of boxplots, and therefore, this tutorial also provides a brief introduction and usage of the R package vioplot with one additional illustration. While the protocol is prepared for the newbies and trainees it will be a handy tool for infrequent users, and may benefit the experienced users as well since it provides scripts for customizing every detail of boxplots.},

abstract = {Male seminal fluid proteins induce a profound remodelling of behavioural,  physiological and gene signalling pathways in females of many taxa, and typically cause elevated egg production and decreased sexual receptivity. In Drosophila melanogaster, these effects can be mediated by an ejaculate 'sex peptide' (SP), which, in addition, contributes significantly to the cost of mating in females. Recent research has revealed that SP can stimulate female post-copulatory feeding, raising the possibility that the widespread female cost of mating could be due to over-feeding. In this study, we used D. melanogaster as a model to test this hypothesis. We first show that elevated post-mating feeding is dependent upon egg production and does not occur in sterile ovoD1 mutant females. This conclusion was also supported by the increase in feeding of virgin females whose egg production was experimentally elevated. We then demonstrated that sterile ovoD1 and fertile females experienced identical survival costs of mating, related to their frequency of mating and not to female feeding rate or to egg production. We conclude that female mating costs are not the result of over-feeding, but may be due to other, potentially more direct, effects of ejaculate molecules.},

abstract = {In Turkey, traffic accidents are the major causes of mortality and morbidity.  According to the statistics made by Turkish Security Headquarters in the year 2000, 7500 people are killed in the traffic accidents every year. Drivers are mostly blamed for the traffic accidents. Tired, weary, sleepy and absentminded driving are common reasons for traffic accidents due to many reasons. Among these reasons mental and reflex conditions of drivers are significant. Toxoplasmosis is one of the most common zoonoses throughout the world. In immunocomponent adults, toxoplasmosis has no clinical signs or symptoms and infection in such people can only be detected by serological examinations. This kind of latent or dormant toxoplasmosis can be located in neural or muscular tissues and cause prolonged reaction times of the muscles. Extended reaction times also lead to deceleration of the reflexes which could be a major cause of the traffic accidents. By the light of this situation, the incidence of Toxoplasma gondii is investigated among the population who were involved in a traffic accident while driving. A total of 185 people (100 men and 85 women), aged between 21 and 40 years, living in Izmir and Manisa cities, were enrolled in the study group (SG) during a period of 6 months time. Their informed consents were taken initially and the laboratory tests of all these individuals related to blood alcohol levels after the accidents were found negative. The control group (CG) were also consisted 185 people (95 men and 90 women), residents of the same region, in same age group. The people in CG had no clinical signs or symptoms concerning toxoplasmosis. All collected sera were examined using a commercial IgG and IgM ELISA kit. According to the results of serological tests of the SG, 45 (24.32%) sera were IgG positive, six (3.24%) were IgM positive and 10 (5.40%) were both IgG and IgM positive. On the other hand in CG, 12 (6.48%) people found IgG positive, one (0.54%) found IgM positive and three (1.62%) found both IgG and IgM positive. This data was considered as statistically significant by Yates corrected chi2-test. (p < 0.05). In conclusion, there is an increased risk for traffic accidents for drivers owing to these high seroprevalence of latent toxoplasmosis. Prospective studies are still necessary on this subject but latent toxoplasmosis of drivers should be taken into account while developing strategies to prevent traffic accidents in Turkey.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that the exploration of multidimensional data with parallel coordinates plot and use of brushing using different colours assists with the identification of relationships and patterns. Parallel coordinates plot visualization facilitates the researcher's skills to find trends, identify outliers and perform quality checks in large multivariate data. We have identified trends in the data that provide directions for further research, and illustrated thereby the potential of parallel coordinates plot to explore patterns and relationships of prenatal oxides of nitrogen exposure with multidimensional birth outcomes. The study recognized the co-occurrence of adverse birth outcomes among infants and these infants had mothers with moderate to high level of NOx exposure during pregnancy. Brushing using different colours facilitated the detection of patterns of relationships to perform basic and advanced statistical model-based analysis.},

abstract = {Kaplan-Meier estimate is one of the best options to be used to measure the  fraction of subjects living for a certain amount of time after treatment. In clinical trials or community trials, the effect of an intervention is assessed by measuring the number of subjects survived or saved after that intervention over a period of time. The time starting from a defined point to the occurrence of a given event, for example death is called as survival time and the analysis of group data as survival analysis. This can be affected by subjects under study that are uncooperative and refused to be remained in the study or when some of the subjects may not experience the event or death before the end of the study, although they would have experienced or died if observation continued, or we lose touch with them midway in the study. We label these situations as censored observations. The Kaplan-Meier estimate is the simplest way of computing the survival over time in spite of all these difficulties associated with subjects or situations. The survival curve can be created assuming various situations. It involves computing of probabilities of occurrence of event at a certain point of time and multiplying these successive probabilities by any earlier computed probabilities to get the final estimate. This can be calculated for two groups of subjects and also their statistical difference in the survivals. This can be used in Ayurveda research when they are comparing two drugs and looking for survival of subjects.},

abstract = {Incremental (distance-dependent) costs and benefits of dispersal have received less attention than those that are qualitative. We present a dynamic programming model of settling behavior using parameters estimated from a field study of dispersal in desert isopods, Hemilepistus reaumuri, which walk up to thousands of meters before settling in new or already-established burrows each spring. The model shows that incremental costs of dispersal lead to right-skewed population dispersal patterns, in contrast to cost-free systems or those with unitary costs (i.e., a one-time cost of leaving a group or patch). In the model, continuous variation in habitat quality, as opposed to discrete suitable vs. unsuitable sites, allows for trade-offs with dispersal costs that lead to shifts in the likelihood of settling in a patch of a given quality. Thus, measurement of quantitative costs and benefits of movement are needed to understand population dispersal distributions. These costs or benefits may be observable during or after movement, and we examined both pre- and postsettling incremental consequences of dispersal. The daily mortality rate of traveling isopods was 4.2\% during the dispersal season, higher than that of settled individuals. Successful settlers traveled more slowly, but burrows started in midseason were most likely to succeed. More distant burrows failed more often, suggesting either an additional cost of movement or a difference in the quality of individuals traveling different distances. The predicted mean dispersal duration from the simulations matched observed values closely, but was based on an unrealistic assumption of perfect knowledge of habitat quality, suggesting some other factor favors longer times before settling. Reproductive success was much higher in re-used burrows than in new burrows, making them a possible incentive for long-distance movements.},

abstract = {Two-way transmission of influenza viruses between humans and swine has been  frequently observed, and the occurrence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (pdm/09) demonstrated that swine-origin viruses could facilitate the genesis of a pandemic strain. Although multiple introductions to and reassortment in swine of the pdm/09 virus have been repeatedly reported in both Eurasia and the Americas, its long-term impact on the development of swine influenza viruses (SIVs) has not been systematically explored. Our comprehensive evolutionary studies of the complete genomes of 387 SIVs obtained from 2009 to 2012 by influenza virus surveillance in China revealed 17 reassortant genotypes with pdm/09-origin genes. Even though the entire 2009 pandemic virus and its surface genes cannot persist, its internal genes have become established and are now the predominant lineages in pigs in the region. The main persistent pdm/09-origin reassortant forms had at least five pdm/09-origin internal genes, and their surface genes were primarily of European avian-like (EA) or human H3N2-like SIV origin. These findings represent a marked change in the evolutionary patterns and ecosystem of SIVs in China. It is possible that the pdm/09-origin internal genes are in the process of replacing EA or triple-reassortant-like internal genes. These alterations in the SIV gene pool need to be continually monitored to assess changes in the potential for SIV transmission to humans. IMPORTANCE: Shortly after the emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pdm/09) influenza virus, it was transmitted from humans to pigs and this continues to occur around the world. Many reassortants between pdm/09-origin viruses and enzootic swine influenza viruses (SIVs) have been detected. However, the long-term impact of pdm/09-origin viruses on the SIV gene pool, which could lead to the generation of influenza viruses with the potential to infect humans, has not been systematically examined. From extensive surveillance of SIVs over a 38-month period in southern China, it was found that although neither complete pdm/09 viruses nor their surface genes could persist in pigs, their internal genes did persist. Over the survey period, these internal genes became predominant, potentially replacing those of the enzootic SIV lineages. The altered diversity of the SIV gene pool needs to be closely monitored for changes in the potential for SIV transmission to humans.},

It can also extract the tree/branch/node-specific and other data from the analysis outputs of beast, epa, hyphy, paml, phylodog, pplacer, r8s, raxml and revbayes software, and allows using these data to annotate the tree. The package allows colouring and annotation of a tree by numerical/categorical node attributes, manipulating a tree by rotating, collapsing and zooming out clades, highlighting user selected clades or operational taxonomic units and exploration of a large tree by zooming into a selected portion. A two-dimensional tree can be drawn by scaling the tree width based on an attribute of the nodes. A tree can be annotated with an associated numerical matrix (as a heat map), multiple sequence alignment, subplots or silhouette images. The package ggtree is released under the artistic-2.0 license.

abstract = {Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis task that has  received widespread attention in the visualization community. The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.},

abstract = {Abstract Heatmap is a widely used statistical visualization method on matrix-like data to reveal similar patterns shared by subsets of rows and columns. In the R programming language, there are many packages that make heatmaps. Among them, the ComplexHeatmap package provides the richest toolset for constructing highly customizable heatmaps. ComplexHeatmap can easily establish connections between multisource information by automatically concatenating and adjusting a list of heatmaps as well as complex annotations, which makes it widely applied in data analysis in many fields, especially in bioinformatics, to find hidden structures in the data. In this article, we give a comprehensive introduction to the current state of ComplexHeatmap, including its modular design, its rich functionalities, and its broad applications.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Emerging preclinical evidence suggests that semaglutide, a  glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, protects against neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. However, real-world evidence for its ability to protect against Alzheimer's disease (AD) is lacking. METHODS: We conducted emulation target trials based on a nationwide database of electronic health records (EHRs) of 116 million US patients. Seven target trials were emulated among 1,094,761 eligible patients with T2DM who had no prior AD diagnosis by comparing semaglutide with seven other antidiabetic medications. First-ever diagnosis of AD occurred within a 3-year follow-up period and was examined using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. RESULTS: Semaglutide was associated with significantly reduced risk for first-time AD diagnosis, most strongly compared with insulin (hazard ratio [HR], 0.33 [95% CI: 0.21 to 0.51]) and most weakly compared with other GLP-1RAs (HR, 0.59 [95% CI: 0.37 to 0.95]). Similar results were seen across obesity status, gender, and age groups. DISCUSSION: These findings support further studies to assess semaglutide's potential in preventing AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Semaglutide was associated with 40% to 70% reduced risks of first-time AD diagnosis in T2DM patients compared to other antidiabetic medications, including other GLP-1RAs. Semaglutide was associated with significantly lower AD-related medication prescriptions. Similar reductions were seen across obesity status, gender, and age groups. Our findings provide real-world evidence supporting the potential clinical benefits of semaglutide in mitigating AD initiation and development in patients with T2DM. These findings support further clinical trials to assess semaglutide's potential in delaying or preventing AD.},

abstract = {Asthma is a chronic inflammatory respiratory disease that affects over 300  million people worldwide. Glucocorticoids are a mainstay therapy for asthma because they exert anti-inflammatory effects in multiple lung tissues, including the airway smooth muscle (ASM). However, the mechanism by which glucocorticoids suppress inflammation in ASM remains poorly understood. Using RNA-Seq, a high-throughput sequencing method, we characterized transcriptomic changes in four primary human ASM cell lines that were treated with dexamethasone--a potent synthetic glucocorticoid (1 µM for 18 hours). Based on a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value <0.05, we identified 316 differentially expressed genes, including both well known (DUSP1, KLF15, PER1, TSC22D3) and less investigated (C7, CCDC69, CRISPLD2) glucocorticoid-responsive genes. CRISPLD2, which encodes a secreted protein previously implicated in lung development and endotoxin regulation, was found to have SNPs that were moderately associated with inhaled corticosteroid resistance and bronchodilator response among asthma patients in two previously conducted genome-wide association studies. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that dexamethasone treatment significantly increased CRISPLD2 mRNA and protein expression in ASM cells. CRISPLD2 expression was also induced by the inflammatory cytokine IL1$\beta$, and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CRISPLD2 further increased IL1$\beta$-induced expression of IL6 and IL8. Our findings offer a comprehensive view of the effect of a glucocorticoid on the ASM transcriptome and identify CRISPLD2 as an asthma pharmacogenetics candidate gene that regulates anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids in the ASM.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Spatiotemporal transcriptomic profiling has provided valuable insight  into the patterning of gene expression throughout the human brain from early fetal development to adulthood. When combined with prior knowledge of a disease's age at onset and region-specificity, these expression profiles have provided the necessary context to both strengthen putative gene-disease associations and infer new associations. While a wealth of spatiotemporal expression data exists, there are currently no tools available to visualize this data within the anatomical context of the brain, thus limiting the intuitive interpretation of many such findings. We present cerebroViz, an R package to map spatiotemporal brain data to vector graphic diagrams of the human brain. Our tool allows rapid generation of publication-quality figures that highlight spatiotemporal trends in the input data, while striking a balance between usability and customization. cerebroViz is generalizable to any data quantifiable at a brain-regional resolution and currently supports visualization of up to thirty regions of the brain found in databases such as BrainSpan, GTEx and Roadmap Epigenomics. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: cerebroViz is freely available through GitHub ( https://github.com/ethanbahl/cerebroViz ). The tutorial is available at http://ethanbahl.github.io/cerebroViz/.

We present screenshots from the interactive version. We also tested the usefulness of our chord diagram with potential users, including family planning researchers and advocates. Chord diagrams are visually appealing and provide users with the ability to investigate unique patterns in contraceptive discontinuation using publicly available data from the DHS. After receiving a brief orientation to a chord diagram, users found the chord diagram easy to understand and manipulate. The chord diagram is a potentially powerful way for family planning researchers, advocates, and program managers to visualize women's contraceptive trajectories and provides insights into the churn in contraceptive use between 2 discrete time periods.},

These libraries identify attributes that confer ECs with their organotypic features. We show that clusters of transcription factors, angiocrine growth factors, adhesion molecules, and chemokines are expressed in unique combinations by ECs of each organ. Furthermore, ECs respond distinctly in tissue regeneration models, hepatectomy, and myeloablation. To test the data set, we developed a transplantation model that employs generic ECs differentiated from embryonic stem cells. Transplanted generic ECs engraft into regenerating tissues and acquire features of organotypic ECs. Collectively, we demonstrate the utility of informational databases of ECs toward uncovering the extravascular and intrinsic signals that define EC heterogeneity. These factors could be exploited therapeutically to engineer tissue-specific ECs for regeneration.},

Visualizations of graph data play important role in interpreting the meaning of graphed data. The adage ``A picture is worth a thousand words'' generally refers to the notion that a complex idea can be conveyed with just a single still image and that is actually the main reason for creating visualisations of any kind. Graph drawings from all domains follow the same rules covered by the graph theory. This work outlines different layout strategies used for drawing graph data. Tested graph drawing layouts are compared by standard quality measures to determine their suitability for various areas of usage.},

We present an exploration of the spatial determinants of reported COVID-19 incidence across India's 641 urban and rural districts, comparing two waves (2020–2021). Three key results emerge using three COVID-19 incidence metrics: cumulative incidence proportion (aggregate risk), cumulative temporal incidence rate, and severity ratio. First, in the same district, characteristics of COVID-19 incidences are similar across waves, with the second wave over four times more severe than the first. Second, after controlling for state-level effects, urbanization (urban population share), living standards, and population age emerge as positive determinants of both risk and rates across waves. Third, keeping all else constant, lower shares of workers working from home correlate with greater infection risk during the second wave. While much attention has focused on intra-urban disease spread, our findings suggest that understanding spatial determinants across human settlements is also important for managing current and future pandemics.},

Additionally, these marine mammal clade viruses share an identical set of mammalian adaptation mutations which were also present in tern viruses. Our combined ecological and phylogenetic data support mammal-to-mammal transmission and occasional mammal-to-bird spillover and suggest multinational transmission of H5N1 viruses in mammals. We reflect that H5N1 viruses becoming more evolutionary flexible and adapting to mammals in new ways could have global consequences for wildlife, humans, and/or livestock.},

abstract = {Geographical mapping of infectious diseases is an important tool for detecting  and characterising outbreaks. Two common mapping methods, dot maps and incidence maps, have important shortcomings. The former does not represent population density and can compromise case privacy, and the latter relies on pre-defined administrative boundaries. We propose a method that overcomes these limitations: dot map cartograms. These create a point pattern of cases while reshaping spatial units, such that spatial area becomes proportional to population size. We compared these dot map cartograms with standard dot maps and incidence maps on four criteria, using two example datasets. Dot map cartograms were able to illustrate both incidence and absolute numbers of cases (criterion 1): they revealed potential source locations (Q fever, the Netherlands) and clusters with high incidence (pertussis, Germany). Unlike incidence maps, they were insensitive to choices regarding spatial scale (criterion 2). Dot map cartograms ensured the privacy of cases (criterion 3) by spatial distortion; however, this occurred at the expense of recognition of locations (criterion 4). We demonstrate that dot map cartograms are a valuable method for detection and visualisation of infectious disease outbreaks, which facilitates informed and appropriate actions by public health professionals, to investigate and control outbreaks.},

In particular, the package provides a broad range of color palettes based on the HCL (hue-chroma-luminance) color space. The three HCL dimensions have been shown to match those of the human visual system very well, thus facilitating intuitive selection of color palettes through trajectories in this space. Using the HCL color model, general strategies for three types of palettes are implemented: (1) Qualitative for coding categorical information, i.e., where no particular ordering of categories is available. (2) Sequential for coding ordered/numeric information, i.e., going from high to low (or vice versa). (3) Diverging for coding ordered/numeric information around a central neutral value, i.e., where colors diverge from neutral to two extremes. To aid selection and application of these palettes, the package also contains scales for use with ggplot2, shiny and tcltk apps for interactive exploration, visualizations of palette properties, accompanying manipulation utilities (like desaturation and lighten/darken), and emulation of color vision deficiencies. The shiny apps are also hosted online at http://hclwizard.org/.},

abstract = {Range boundaries are a fundamental expression of a species' relationship with other species and with the abiotic environment. In this study, I examined the roles of biotic and abiotic factors in setting the local range limits of Mazzaella parksii (formerly Mazzaella cornucopiae). In Washington State, this turf-forming red alga occurs almost exclusively in a discrete high intertidal band on north-facing, wave-exposed shores. I investigated the mechanisms underlying these distributional patterns via a series of intra- and extra-limital transplant experiments coupled with manipulations of interacting species and abiotic stress. The upper limit of Mazzaella was set by physiological stress; turfs transplanted above the natural Mazzaella zone bleached and died over the course of a few months. Mazzaella's lower limit was set by herbivory; turfs transplanted below the natural zone were consumed in treatments accessible to grazers but thrived in herbivore-exclusion plots. South-facing transplants at the same intertidal height as the natural north-facing Mazzaella zone declined regardless of interspecific interactions, indicating that Mazzaella's upper limit is lower on south-facing shores. However, the position of the herbivore-determined lower limit was similar between aspects. South-facing transplants could survive below the natural Mazzaella zone if the grazer-determined lower limit was extended downshore by herbivore exclusions or at Mazzaella's natural intertidal height (i.e., the height at which it persists on north-facing surfaces) if the physiologically determined upper limit was extended upshore by experimental shades. In the absence of such experimental modifications, Mazzaella was effectively excluded from south-facing shores because its upper limit had converged on its lower limit. Thus, abiotic factors and biological factors interact to set the horizontal distributional limits of this alga. This conceptual model is consistent with Mazzaella's distribution at a variety of spatial scales and has broad implications for both spatial patterns and temporal trends in the distribution and abundance of species.

abstract = {Color vision deficiency (CVD) affects more than 4% of the population and leads to a different visual perception of colors. Though this has been known for decades, colormaps with many colors across the visual spectra are often used to represent data, leading to the potential for misinterpretation or difficulty with interpretation by someone with this deficiency. Until the creation of the module presented here, there were no colormaps mathematically optimized for CVD using modern color appearance models. While there have been some attempts to make aesthetically pleasing or subjectively tolerable colormaps for those with CVD, our goal was to make optimized colormaps for the most accurate perception of scientific data by as many viewers as possible. We developed a Python module, cmaputil, to create CVD-optimized colormaps, which imports colormaps and modifies them to be perceptually uniform in CVD-safe colorspace while linearizing and maximizing the brightness range. The module is made available to the science community to enable others to easily create their own CVD-optimized colormaps. Here, we present an example CVD-optimized colormap created with this module that is optimized for viewing by those without a CVD as well as those with red-green colorblindness. This colormap, cividis, enables nearly-identical visual-data interpretation to both groups, is perceptually uniform in hue and brightness, and increases in brightness linearly.},

@article{Riedel20,
abstract = {Recent work has raised awareness about the need to replace bar graphs of  continuous data with informative graphs showing the data distribution. The impact of these efforts is not known. The present observational meta-research study examined how often scientists in different fields use various graph types, and assessed whether visualization practices have changed between 2010 and 2020. We developed and validated an automated screening tool, designed to identify bar graphs of counts or proportions, bar graphs of continuous data, bar graphs with dot plots, dot plots, box plots, violin plots, histograms, pie charts, and flow charts. Papers from 23 fields (approximately 1000 papers/field per year) were randomly selected from PubMed Central and screened (n=227998). F1 scores for different graphs ranged between 0.83 and 0.95 in the internal validation set. While the tool also performed well in external validation sets, F1 scores were lower for uncommon graphs. Bar graphs are more often used incorrectly to display continuous data than they are used correctly to display counts or proportions. The proportion of papers that use bar graphs of continuous data varies markedly across fields (range in 2020: 4-58%), with high rates in biochemistry and cell biology, complementary and alternative medicine, physiology, genetics, oncology and carcinogenesis, pharmacology, microbiology and immunology. Visualization practices have improved in some fields in recent years. Fewer than 25% of papers use flow charts, which provide information about attrition and the risk of bias. The present study highlights the need for continued interventions to improve visualization and identifies fields that would benefit most.},

However, low- and middle-income countries, in which approximately 84% of the world's population lives1, are not equitably represented in large-scale gut microbiome research2–4. Here we present the AWI-Gen 2 Microbiome Project, a cross-sectional gut microbiome study sampling 1,801 women from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. By engaging with communities that range from rural and horticultural to post-industrial and urban informal settlements, we capture a far greater breadth of the world's population diversity. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we identify taxa with geographic and lifestyle associations, including Treponema and Cryptobacteroides species loss and Bifidobacterium species gain in urban populations. We uncover 1,005 bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes, and we identify antibiotic susceptibility as a factor that might drive. Treponema succinifaciens absence in urban populations. Finally, we find an HIV infection signature defined by several taxa not previously associated with HIV, including Dysosmobacter welbionis and Enterocloster sp. This study represents the largest population-representative survey of gut metagenomes of African individuals so far, and paired with extensive clinical biomarkers and demographic data, provides extensive opportunity for microbiome-related discovery.},

Hippocampal and medial temporal lobe volumes are larger in higher-fit adults, and physical activity training increases hippocampal perfusion, but the extent to which aerobic exercise training can modify hippocampal volume in late adulthood remains unknown. Here we show, in a randomized controlled trial with 120 older adults, that aerobic exercise training increases the size of the anterior hippocampus, leading to improvements in spatial memory. Exercise training increased hippocampal volume by 2%, effectively reversing age-related loss in volume by 1 to 2 y. We also demonstrate that increased hippocampal volume is associated with greater serum levels of BDNF, a mediator of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. Hippocampal volume declined in the control group, but higher preintervention fitness partially attenuated the decline, suggesting that fitness protects against volume loss. Caudate nucleus and thalamus volumes were unaffected by the intervention. These theoretically important findings indicate that aerobic exercise training is effective at reversing hippocampal volume loss in late adulthood, which is accompanied by improved memory function.},

Cows' milk is typically pasteurised to render it safe for human consumption, but the effectiveness of pasteurisation on influenza viruses in milk was uncertain. To assess this, here we evaluate heat inactivation in milk for a panel of different influenza viruses. This includes human and avian influenza A viruses (IAVs), an influenza D virus that naturally infects cattle, and recombinant IAVs carrying contemporary avian or bovine H5N1 glycoproteins. At pasteurisation temperatures of 63°C and 72°C, we find that viral infectivity is rapidly lost and becomes undetectable before the times recommended for pasteurisation (30 minutes and 15 seconds, respectively). We then show that an H5N1 HPAIV in milk is effectively inactivated by a comparable treatment, even though its genetic material remains detectable. We conclude that pasteurisation conditions should effectively inactivate H5N1 HPAIV in cows' milk, but that unpasteurised milk could carry infectious influenza viruses.},

They were exposed to either high PM concentrations or clean air for one hour, using normal inhalation or restricted nasal inhalation and olfaction with a nose clip. Participants completed four cognitive tests before and four hours after exposure, assessing working memory, selective attention, emotion expression discrimination, and psychomotor vigilance. Results showed significant reductions in selective attention and emotion expression discrimination after enhanced PM versus clean air exposure. Air quality did not significantly impact psychomotor vigilance or working memory performance. Inhalation method did not significantly mediate effects, suggesting that short-term PM pollution affects cognitive function through lung-brain mechanisms, either directly or indirectly.},

abstract = {During infection and cancer, mTORC1-mediated metabolic regulation impacts CD8+ T cell effector expansion and memory development. However, the mechanisms by which CD8+ T cells regulate mTORC1 to support their unique metabolic requirements remain unknown. Here we show that NKG7, a lysosomal protein whose expression is restricted to cytotoxic lymphocytes, negatively regulates mTORC1 recruitment and activation by inhibiting assembly and function of the lysosomal proton pump, vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase). Human and mouse CD8+ T cells lacking NKG7 show more acidic lysosomes and increased activation of mTORC1 signaling, which could be reversed by inhibition of v-ATPase activity. In mice responding to LCMV infection, NKG7-deleted effector CD8+ T cells are less durable and generate fewer memory precursors, whereas induced expression of NKG7 in CD8+ T cells results in increased presence of intra-tumoral T cells. Overall, our work identifies NKG7 as a CD8+ T cell-specific regulator of mTORC1 activity, required for optimal immune responses.},

When the outcome is continuous, a common statistical test is a usual t-test for a two-group comparison. For more than 2 groups, an ANOVA setup is used and the test for equality for all groups is based on the F-distribution. A key assumption for these parametric tests is that data are normally, independently distributed and the response variances are equal. The robustness of these tests to the first two assumptions is quite well investigated, but the issues arising from heteroscedasticity are less studied. This paper reviews different methods for ascertaining homogeneity of variance across groups and investigates the consequences of heteroscedasticity on the tests. Simulations based on normal, heavy-tailed, and skewed normal data demonstrate that some of the less known methods, such as the Jackknife or Cochran's test, are quite effective in detecting differences in the variances.},

A significant P value of the ANOVA test indicates for at least one pair, between which the mean difference was statistically significant. To identify that significant pair(s), we use multiple comparisons. In ANOVA, when using one categorical independent variable, it is called one-way ANOVA, whereas for two categorical independent variables, it is called two-way ANOVA. When using at least one covariate to adjust with dependent variable, ANOVA becomes ANCOVA. When the size of the sample is small, mean is very much affected by the outliers, so it is necessary to keep sufficient sample size while using these methods.},

Because of its continued relevance in modern psychology, this centennial anniversary is an excellent opportunity to take stock of what Gestalt psychology has offered and how it has changed since its inception. We first introduce the key findings and ideas in the Berlin school of Gestalt psychology, and then briefly sketch its development, rise, and fall. Next, we discuss its empirical and conceptual problems, and indicate how they are addressed in contemporary research on perceptual grouping and figure-ground organization. In particular, we review the principles of grouping, both classical (e.g., proximity, similarity, common fate, good continuation, closure, symmetry, parallelism) and new (e.g., synchrony, common region, element and uniform connectedness), and their role in contour integration and completion. We then review classic and new image-based principles of figure-ground organization, how it is influenced by past experience and attention, and how it relates to shape and depth perception. After an integrated review of the neural mechanisms involved in contour grouping, border ownership, and figure-ground perception, we conclude by evaluating what modern vision science has offered compared to traditional Gestalt psychology, whether we can speak of a Gestalt revival, and where the remaining limitations and challenges lie. A better integration of this research tradition with the rest of vision science requires further progress regarding the conceptual and theoretical foundations of the Gestalt approach, which is the focus of a second review article.},

Trapping surveys were completed at seven sites from southern Victoria to central Queensland. The variables measured from each of the 102 animals captured included head length, skull width, total body length, tail length, pes length, length of the ear conch, body girth, belly girth and the pelage colour. Canonical variate analysis highlighted the existence of a marked separation between populations in Victoria and those in New South Wales and Queensland. The first canonical variate accounted for 89% of the variation between the populations and was dominated by the length of the ear conch, tail length and pes length. There also were differences between the populations for several other morphometric measures including the head and body length. We recorded considerable variation in the fur colour of T. caninus both within and between the populations surveyed. However, no consistent pattern in the geographic variation of fur coloration was evident. We do not know the ecological or evolutionary causes underlying the observed differences in morphological characteristics amongst the populations of T. caninus. Further work is planned to examine the genetic variability of the populations and to assess the taxonomic significance of our findings. },

abstract = {The structure of human deoxyhaemoglobin was refined at 1.74 {\AA} resolution using data collected on film at room temperature from a synchrotron X-ray source. The erystallographic R-factor is 16.0%. The estimated error in atomic positions is 0.1 {\AA} overall, 0.14 {\AA} for main-chain atoms of internal segments, and 0.05 {\AA} for the iron atoms. The effects of intermolecular contacts on the structure were investigated; such contacts cause only highly localized distortions, as judged from the degree of molecular asymmetry that they induce. The geometry of the iron-nitrogen complex closely resembles that of the deoxymyoglobin structure of Takano (1977) and of the 5-co-ordinated model compounds of Hoard (1975) and Jameson et al. (1980). The distance of the iron from the mean plane of N(porphyrin) is 0.40(5) {\AA} and 0.36(5) {\AA}, respectively, at the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ haems, in contrast to the corresponding distance of + 0.12(8) {\AA} and −0.11(8) {\AA} in oxyhaemoglobin (Shaanan, 1983); the FeN$\epsilon$(F8) bond length is 2.12(4) {\AA} and the FeN(porphyrin) bond length is 2.06(2) {\AA}; the last is also in good agreement with extended X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurements on deoxyhaemoglobin (Eisenberger et al., 1978Eisenberger et al., 1978; Perutz, 1968Perutz et al., 1982). The haems are domed toward the proximal side; the separation between the mean planes of N(porphyrin) and C(porphyrin) being 0.16(6) {\AA} and 0.10(6) {\AA}, respectively at the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ haems. At the $\alpha$ haems, the normals to the mean pyrrole planes are tilted uniformly toward the haem centre, by about three degrees relative to the haem normal, and there is a folding of about four degrees of the haem about an axis running between the methene carbons that are between the pyrrole rings bearing like-type side-chains. At the $\beta$ haems, there is no such folding, and only pyrroles II and IV (those eclipsed by His F8) are appreciably tilted, by about eight degrees. The independence of these parameters from restraints imposed on the model was verified by unrestrained refinement of the entire molecule starting from a structure with modified haem geometry.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional information visualizations are widely used in various fields for their aesthetic appeal. However, using them can sometimes lead to occlusion and distortion, which raises questions about when and why to use them. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of three-dimensional visualizations on human gaze and user understanding and analyze the perception process in detail. Our empirical research consisted of a two-part experimental study that involved both subjective and objective evaluation. We specifically focused on bar charts as they are among the most frequently used types of information visualizations. The results suggest that, for bar chart visualizations with varying gap dimensions, there is no statistically significant difference in user understanding between the two-dimensional and three-dimensional versions. Our findings indicate that, in general, three-dimensional bar chart visualizations are as comprehensible as their two-dimensional counterparts for the gap dimensions examined in this research. This study provides empirical insights demonstrating that both 3D and 2D bar charts are equally understandable, particularly when a specific gap depth is used in 3D visualizations. These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion about the effective use of three-dimensional visualizations and highlight areas for further research.},

abstract = {Abstract Effective data visualisation is vital for data exploration, analysis and communication in research. In ecology and evolutionary biology, data are often associated with various taxonomic entities. Graphics of organisms associated with these taxa are valuable for framing results within a broader biological context. However, acquiring and using such resources can be challenging due to availability and licensing constraints. The PhyloPic database solves many of these issues by making organism silhouettes freely available. Tools that integrate this database with existing research workflows are needed to remove hurdles associated with data visualisation in the biological sciences. Here, we introduce rphylopic, an R package for fetching, transforming and visualising silhouettes of organisms from the PhyloPic database. In addition to making over 8000 organism silhouettes available within the R programming language, rphylopic empowers users to modify the appearance of these silhouettes for ultimate customisability when coding production?quality visualisations in both base R and ggplot2 workflows. In this work, we provide details about how the package can be installed, its implementation and potential use cases. For the latter, we showcase three examples across the ecology and evolutionary biology spectrum. Our hope is that rphylopic will make it easier for biologists to develop more accessible and engaging data visualisations by making external resources readily accessible, customisable and usable within R. In turn, by integrating into existing workflows, rphylopic helps to ensure that science is reproducible and accessible.},

To address this need, we present the Generic Diagramming Platform (GDP, https://BioGDP.com), a comprehensive database of professionally crafted biomedical graphics (bio-graphics). Currently, GDP houses 7 562 high-quality bio-graphics, meticulously categorized into 10 major and 77 minor categories. To increase the design efficiency, GDP provides 204 customizable templates derived from an extensive review of over 2000 literature and 7 textbooks. With the interactive drawing platform and user-friendly web interface implemented in GDP, these resources can facilitate the efficient generation of publication-ready illustrations for the biomedical community. Additionally, GDP incorporates a collaborative submission system, allowing researchers to contribute their artwork, fostering a growing diagramming ecosystem, and ensuring continuous database expansion. Overall, we believe that GDP will serve as an invaluable platform, significantly enhancing the efficiency and quality of scientific illustration for biomedical researchers.},
